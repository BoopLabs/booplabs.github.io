        <h1 class="title">Boop! Labs and Innatical Team up for an Open Ecosystem.</h1>
        <p> Boop! Labs has partnered with Innatical to create an ecosystem designed for experience and productivity. 

Boop! Linux will ship with Pax, a package manager built from the ground up for developers. Our goal is to allow developers to go from Tarball to Package in minutes. Pax will be available to test for those who eat the unknown for breakfast in the coming weeks. If you'd rather wait for an ISO you can expect one in Q4 2021-Q1 2022.

In addition to Pax we will be shipping Innatical ID as an identity provider on Boop! Linux. This provider will integrate with Pax to allow application records to be synced.

We are also proud to announce that a wrapper of the Innatical Cloud dashboard and Inncloud CLI will be included in the developer bundle. This is part of out mission to allow developers to build and test without leaving their desk.

We would like to thank the fantastic executive team at Innatical for their work on this deal, primarily Lea Gray. </p>
